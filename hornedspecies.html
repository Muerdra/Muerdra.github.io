 		<h1>Jackalope</h1>
		<img src ="Pictures/jackalope.jpg" class="responsive" alt ="Jackalope" </>
  		<p>In North American folklore, a jackalope is a jackrabbit with the horns of an antelope. 
		One has never been sighted. We are pleased to confirm its existence on Toha Island.
		It behaves and has a diet similar to a North American jackrabbit. The horns are used as a weapon 
		when males are courting or territorial.</p>

  		<h1>Wild Boar Oxen</h1>
		<img src ="Pictures/WildBoarOxen.jpeg" class="responsive" alt ="Wild Boar Oxen">
  		<p>These creatures, although seeming to look intimidating, are very gentle and tend to stay out of another creaturesâ€™ way. 
			Found in the forested areas, the Wild Boar Oxen tend to remain within their herds and can often be seen running through the fields of grass with their companions. 
			They are monogamous and tend to have two to three babies in their lifetime. They eat grass and other plants and do not eat meat. 
			These animals do not hibernate but instead develop a thicker coat of fur and continue to thrive. 
			Most of their reproduction is also done around the Fall time, when it begins to get colder. 
			These creatures span up to 80 years, with some oxen even living up to 100 years. They have no known predators, 
			other than hunters..</p>

		<h1>Two Bellied Unicorn</h1>
		<img src ="Pictures/TwoBelliedUnicorn.jpeg" class="responsive" alt ="Wild Boar Oxen">	
  		
  		<p>These animals are abundant all throughout the island. These two bellied unicorns are not shy animals and constantly show themselves to other species and humans. 
			Their second belly often gives them the appearance that makes them look pregnant. 
			However, a big distinction between genders is the lack of horn for a female, and presence of horn for males. 
			They mate monogamously and have about two to three babies every five years. They eat fruit and any root plants that grow in the ground. 
			They like to establish their territories in groups and are rarely seen together. 
			They have no known predators and their numbers have remained large in recent years.</p>
