    <h2>ANIME</h2>
    <p>Since my highschool days I've been a casual watcher of anime. I have a huge respect for animation and fantasy. An old friend lent me one of the first anime's I ever watched, My-Hime.</p>
	<p>After watching that anime, I immediately watched the second season and have since watched perhaps a hundred since then with no stop in sight. </p>
	<br>
	
    <h2>DRAWING</h2>
    <p>Drawing has been a vent and relaxation for me. I've only started to try and learn how to better myself through videos and books (on and off the web).</p>
	<br>


    <h2>GAMING</h2>
    <p>PC Gaming for me was quite an experience. From my early days of StarCraft/BroodWar, WarCraft II, Total Annihilation, Total Annihilation Kingdoms and Age of Empires/II.</p>
	<p>Evolving into my love of turn-based fantasy with a game called Age of Wonders 2. I've since branched into card games like Shadowverse. A little franchise called Dawn of War and Warframe.</p>

  <p>Throughout my years I've played many a game and delved into their universes. But the two that have earned a place in my hall-of-fame are <a href="https://warframe.com">Warframe</a> and <a href="https://warhammer40k.fandom.com">Warhammer</a>
  Both Warframe and Warhammer 40k have shaped myself and influenced the world of my story (not all things are sunshine and rainbows). And of course I had to draw the Imperium of Man's finest, Grey Knight.</div>
