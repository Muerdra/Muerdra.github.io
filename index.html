<p>Hello! We are explorers part of the infamous Pacific expedition. During our journey to the East, we discovered an uncharted island
		 	 in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. We visited the island and found that it was home to many strange and undocumented creatures.
			  We have named the island Toha Island. This website is dedicated to our findings.<br>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
	Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text 
ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s 
with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum </P>
