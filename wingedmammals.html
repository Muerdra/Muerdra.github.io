 		<h1>Winged Dog</h1>
		<img src ="Pictures/wingeddog.jpg" class="responsive" alt ="Winged Dog">
		<div class= "parani">
  		<p>The Winged Dog is a very strange creature. Although it possesses wings, it cannot fly due to it's large head. It resembles a chihuahua and has wings reminiscent of a bald eagle. Its diet conists of palm leaves and tree bramble.</p>

  		<h1>Super Vampire Bat</h1>
		<img src ="Pictures/supervampirebat.jpg" class="responsive" alt ="Super Vampire Bat">
		<div class= parani">
  		<p>The Super Vampire Bat has been called "super" because of its cape. The cape helps the bat fly since its small wings alone cannot support the bat in flight. The Super Vampire Bat has exactly the same habits as the North American Vampire Bat except for the fact that it can survive in space. </p>

	<div id="Animal3" class="tabcontent">	<!--Rebecca Sherwin-->
  		<h1>Winged Rabbit</h1>
		<img src ="Pictures/wingedrabbit.jpg" class="responsive" alt ="Winged Rabbit">
		<div class="parani">
  		<p>Although the winged rabbit is not technically winged, its large ears can act as wings. By jumping in the air and fluttering their ears, this species can hover above the ground for up to ten seconds. We have observed this behaviour when the winged rabbit is crossing rivers or uneven terrain.</p>
	</div>
	 </div>
	<div id="Animal4" class="tabcontent">	<!--Rebecca Sherwin-->
  		<h1>Winged Mouse</h1>
		<img src ="Pictures/wingedmouse.jpg" class="responsive" alt ="Winged Mouse">
	<div class="parani">
  		<p>The winged mouse has a very plump body that its wings barely support in flight. Its arms have extra skin that may be used to control its direction in flight, similar to a flying squirrel. Its diet conists of insects and wildberries.</p>
