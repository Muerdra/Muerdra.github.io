 		<h1>Rose Phoenix</h1>
		<img src ="Pictures/RosePhoenix.png" class="responsive" alt ="Rose Phoenix">
  		<p>These birds are found in the mountainous regions of this island. They are given the name Rose Phoenix because of their mating habits of laying their eggs near rose plants. 
		   They do not shy away from humans and other species, but they tend to stay within their own territory, mainly for safety but also out of respect to other animals. They are a very social bird, often travelling in groups and rarely spotted on their own. 
		   These birds tend to only breed during the spring and also mate for life and lay up to 3 eggs. The birds find their mate when the male presents the female with the brightest flower they can possibly find. They feed on fruit and plants, and do not eat meat.  
		   These birds live up to about 90 years because theyâ€™re the least hunted.

  		<h1>Flaming Frill Phoenix</h1>
		<img src ="Pictures/FlamingFrillPhoenix.png" class="responsive" alt ="Flaming Frill Phoenix">
  		<p>The Flaming Frills are the rarest type of Phoenix due to their frilled feathers that hang from their wings and tail. They are found in the caverns of this island and do not leave their homes. Due to hunting and capturing of these birds, less than 5,000 remain today. 
		   These birds tend to feed on both insects and fish but also feed on plants and fruit if necessary. They do not remain monogamous throughout their lives and will often find a mate every five to seven years. They can lay up to 3 eggs at a time. 
		   The way they find their mate is through a mating dance but also a display of the most frilled feathers. The male phoenix that has the most frills on their tails and wings earns the attention of the female and thus earns the rate to mate with her. 
		   These birds live up to 20 years.</p>

		<h1>Golden Egg Phoenix</h1>
		<img src ="Pictures/GoldenEggPhoenix.png" class="responsive" alt ="Golden Egg Phoenix">	
		<p>These birds are slowly heading towards extinction as they are frequently being hunted and captured for sport. They are found in the fields, specifically wheat fields, which is what makes them very tricky to locate as they blend in with the yellow of the fields. 
		   They eat insects. These birds can be either monogamous or have many mates in its lifetime. These birds can live up to 50 years and tend to lay about an average of 10 eggs in their lifetime. They also lay eggs that have a shiny golden sheen to them, which is where their name comes from.
		   They find their mates when the males present the females with the most insects that they can find.

		<h1>Aquaphoenix</h1>
		<img src ="Pictures/Aquaphoenix.jpg" class="responsive" alt ="Sponge" </>
		<p>The Liquidis Arvelax or aquaphoenix as its being referred to as may give us the answers we seek in cancer research. This liquid-like bird has proven to have incredible forming capabilities the likes we humans can only imagine. However only
		   only the one, named Arvelax has been found thus far. Scientists and activists alike are taking precautions with this bird, though seems to be as fascinated with us as shown in one of the many leaked videos showcasing this fascinating bird
		   climbing a tree. It does seem unable to fly however, though whether that is due to its liquid form or not we here at Toha Island do not know.
