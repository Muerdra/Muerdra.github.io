  		<p>These birds are found in the mountainous regions of this island. They are given the name Rose Phoenix because of their mating habits of laying their eggs near rose plants. 
			They do not shy away from humans and other species, but they tend to stay within their own territory, mainly for safety but also out of respect to other animals. They are a very social bird, often travelling in groups and rarely spotted on their own. 
			These birds tend to only breed during the spring and also mate for life and lay up to 3 eggs. The birds find their mate when the male presents the female with the brightest flower they can possibly find. They feed on fruit and plants, and do not eat meat.  
			These birds live up to about 90 years because theyâ€™re the least hunted.</p>

  		<p>The Phoenix was known to be a majestic bird-like creature that lived in Paradise. 
			The Phoenix, like all other creatures who live in Paradise, was known to live a good life. 
			It was a land of unimaginable perfection and beauty and was said to exist somewhere beyond the brilliance of the sun. 
			However, in time, the bird began to feel the affects of its age. 
			After 1,000 years had passed, it was ready to move on.</p>
